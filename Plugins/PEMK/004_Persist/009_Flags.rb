# PEMK :: Flags  (client side — the switches/variables/self-switches projection)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The north-star gap the audit named: RPG-Maker switches, variables and self-
# switches — quest progression, story flags and every one-shot event marker —
# had NO server representation at all. They lived only inside the opaque save
# blob, so the server could not even SEE that a player rewound their story; and
# rewinding a self-switch re-arms every NPC gift, TM, HM and key-item event.
#
# This projects the NON-DEFAULT set (a switch is false and a variable 0 by
# default), so a real save is a few hundred ids rather than 10,000 slots. It is
# a DETECTION shadow — the server records it and flags a rewind, it does not
# correct anything. Making the server authoritative here needs the world-vs-
# player ID partition, which is a game-design decision.
#
# Reads the ivars directly (the engine classes are plain @data wrappers) so no
# engine file is touched and no accessor is added to core.
