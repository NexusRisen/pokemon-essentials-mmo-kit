  # Server-authoritative economy. The client sends the ABSOLUTE post-clamp value
  # for a field with a per-channel seq (the observer only ever sees the absolute,
  # so a reconnect-safe delta is impossible to compute client-side). We validate
  # against the game cap, dedup by ledger-row existence (gap-safe idempotency), and
  # keep a materialized balance. This is cap-enforcement + an audit trail — NOT
  # anti-cheat: a modified client can still inject a within-cap value (reason stays
  # :unattributed). All calls run inside a per-player mailbox, so a given account's
  # mutations are already serialized (no read-modify-write race).
  class Ledger
    # Fields whose value is PROGRESSION rather than currency: they only ever grow, so
    # the server unions instead of assigning and a rollback cannot erase them. Enabled
    # with the sovereignty layer (flag_state); a fork that deliberately revokes badges
    # in a story beat must keep that off, or clear the balance through an operator path.
