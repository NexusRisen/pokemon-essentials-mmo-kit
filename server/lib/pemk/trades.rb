  # Server-authoritative trading — the atomic ownership swap (M3.2). This is the
  # single security invariant of the whole feature: a trade moves owner_account_id
  # for every uid in ONE @db.transaction or none of them move. Everything else
  # (handshake, escrow, UI) is UX layered on top and cannot violate this.
  #
  # Threats defeated here, regardless of what a fully-modified client does:
  #  - DUPE: all uids are FOR UPDATE-locked in ascending id order (a deadlock-free
  #    total order), each CAS requires owner==seller, and the summed rowcount must
  #    equal the expected count or the WHOLE trade rolls back. Two concurrent trades
  #    over a shared uid serialize on the lock; the loser re-evaluates its CAS
  #    against the new owner, matches 0 rows, and aborts.
  #  - THEFT: the CAS `owner_account_id == seller` clause matches 0 rows for any uid
  #    the seller does not currently own -> abort.
  #  - FLAGGED/CLONED laundering: `flagged == false` in the CAS gates them out.
  #  - REPLAY: the pre-swap trade_id check + UNIQUE(trade_id, uid) make a re-sent
  #    swap an idempotent no-op.
  # NOT secured here (M4): the traded Pokémon OBJECT's stat/acquisition legality.
