  # M4 Layer D D8: the VERDICT SWEEP — consumes stamped battle_records verdicts and
  # turns them into monster state, on the LIVE server's worker pool (the harness
  # NEVER touches monsters; single-writer). Design: "provisional-until-verified,
  # walk-tier bite".
  #
  #   VERIFY   — a `match` record bound to a provisional mon promotes it to
  #              verify_state='verified' (releases the trade hold; the D9
  #              ranked-eligibility asset). `on` only.
  #   CONDEMN  — a `walk_mismatch` record (ingest-time seed refutation — the ONLY
  #              tier that can condemn; harness `mismatch` is version-drift-prone
  #              and only WITHHOLDS 'verified') poisons its roll and quarantines
  #              the caught mon, GATED by: MIN_STRIKES distinct refuted battles per
  #              account (drift-tolerant), and an FP-STORM breaker (suppress if a
  #              whole engine_fp cohort is failing — likely our bug / a mass event,
  #              not one cheater). `on` acts; `shadow` audits would_quarantine only.
  #
  # Idempotent: enforcement_action + enforced_at stamp each processed record; every
  # decision (including suppressions) writes an enforcement_events audit row.
  # NEVER touches EXP/money/the flagged bit; quarantine rides monsters.status only
  # (the M3.2 trade CAS already requires status='active').
